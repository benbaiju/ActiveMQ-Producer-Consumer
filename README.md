# ActiveMQ Producer-Consumer

This repository contains a simple example of implementing a producer-consumer pattern using Apache ActiveMQ. The producer-consumer pattern is a classic design pattern used to demonstrate asynchronous communication between components in a software system.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Apache ActiveMQ installed or accessible
- Maven for building and managing the project (optional but recommended)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/activemq-producer-consumer.git
   cd activemq-producer-consumer
   

2. Install dependencies (if using Maven).

   bash
   mvn clean install
   

## Running the Producer

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

2. Compile and run the producer application.

3. The producer will prompt you to enter a message. After entering a message, it will be sent to the ActiveMQ queue.

## Running the Consumer

1. Open another terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

2. Compile and run the consumer application.

3. The consumer will continuously listen to the ActiveMQ queue for incoming messages and process them as they arrive.

## Customization

You can customize the ActiveMQ connection settings, queue names, and other configurations in the `application.properties` file.

## Troubleshooting

- If the producer or consumer is not working as expected, ensure that ActiveMQ is up and running and that the connection details are correctly configured.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or want to enhance the example, feel free to submit a pull request.
